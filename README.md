Student Performance Prediction Project with AWS Deployment
Problem: Developed a machine learning model to predict student test scores based on factors like Gender, Ethnicity, and Parental Preparation Course participation. The aim was to identify which factors most significantly affect academic performance and provide insights for improving student support systems.

Approach:

Data Collection: Collected student data including demographics and test scores.
Data Processing: Cleaned and preprocessed the data using techniques like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Modeling: Used Scikit-learn to train various machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Linear Regression) and evaluated them to select the best-performing model.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed the relationships between the data features and test scores to inform model training.
Solution & Deployment:

Deployed the final machine learning model on AWS Elastic Beanstalk for scalable and automated hosting.
Utilized Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib for model development and data visualization.
AWS Elastic Beanstalk was used for easy deployment and scaling, while EC2 instances hosted the model, ensuring seamless access for real-time predictions.
